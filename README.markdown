# Vim Configuration

This repository contains my setup for both **[Vim][]** and **[Neovim][]**. I've
decided to move my personal development environment over to Neovim after reading
[Greer's post][1] on the matter. The intent of this repository is to allow a
semi-backward compatible environment where I can have a similar configuration
for both editors. The intent is to move _completely_ to **neovim**.
