# Vim Configuration

This repository contains my setup for **[Neovim][]**. I've decided to move my
personal development environment over to Neovim after reading [Greer's post][1]
on the matter. This comes souped up with close to 80 (or more plugins) to
enhance my development experience with a very short start time (~11ms on my
[laptop][]).
