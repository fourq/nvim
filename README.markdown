# Vim Configuration

This repository contains my setup for **[Neovim][]**. I've decided to move my
personal development environment over to Neovim after reading [Greer's post][1]
on the matter. This comes souped up with close to 80 (or more plugins) to
enhance my development experience with a very short start time (~11ms on my
[laptop][]).

Neovim, as of version 0.1.0, doesn’t use the classic `~/.nvimrc` setup. However,
because of habit, I’ve linked `~/.nvimrc` to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`. Some
habits die hard.

This was finalized 2015-11-04 00:05:00 EST.
