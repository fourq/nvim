# .vimrc configuration
This repository holds my personal configuration for Vim. It has all of the
colors, core bundles, and options needed to get it kicking and roaring with
Vim.

I use [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage my
dotfiles and what not. This repository is set up for it. Feel free to use to
your heart's content.

## Contents
This Vim setup is constantly tweaked to my comfort; taking advantage of my
left-handed nature and makes the assumption that you're using all of the
extensions provided by Vundle.
