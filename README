# .vimrc configuration
This repository holds my personal configuration for Vim. It has all of the
colors, core bundles, and options needed to get it kicking and roaring with
Vim.

I use [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage my
dotfiles and what not. This repository is set up for it. Feel free to use to
your heart's content.

If you've installed this out of the box with homeshick (or any Vim setup for
that matter), it'll automatically set up Vundle and download all of the
plug-ins.

## Contents
This Vim setup is constantly tweaked to my comfort; taking advantage of my
left-handed nature and makes the assumption that you're using all of the
extensions provided by Vundle. If you want to check out the plug-ins I've
added, look at the [file listing][] them.
